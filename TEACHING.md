ClojureBridge Teacher's Guide 
=============================

There are many ways to teach the ClojureBridge material, and none of them are "right." The following is a guide to working though the curriculum with students based on the experience of some workshop organizers and teachers.

There are six pieces to the curriculum: the curriculum
[slides and narrative](http://clojurebridge.github.io/curriculum),
and the capstone app part.1:
[Drawing Lines](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/drawing/blob/master/curriculum/first-program.md).
For capstone app part. 2,
[Turtles Walk](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/welcometoclojurebridge/blob/master/outline/TURTLE-SAMPLES.md)
(for function study),
[Snowflakes](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/drawing/blob/master/curriculum/create-something.md)
(another drawing app),
[Twinkle Little Star](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/tones/blob/master/curriculum/01-piano-chords.md) (making sounds),
[Global Growth](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/global-growth)  (web app with REST api),
[Caesar Cipher](http://clojurebridge.github.io/community-docs/docs/exercises/caesar-cipher/)
(mini exercise of Strings and Characters).

You may skip bonus sections and a module to fit with a workshop
progress. However, to go over part. 2 capstone apps, some bonuses should
be covered. For example, Turtle and Twinkle use sequences and let
binding. Snowflakes app is the easiest to try out. It just needs a flow
control in addition to the part. 1 app. Global Growth is quite a high
level app and only for very advanced students. Copy&pasting code only
won't take so long, but it requires REST API and ring/compojure knowledge.

The slides and the narrative curriculum are the exactly the same
files. The slide forms are what you show on the projector in front of
the room, while the narrative forms are easy to read detailed
explanation of what is introduced in the slides. Students follow along
with the narrative on their own computers or use it to work on their
own.

Curriculum
----------
Fork the curriculum [repository](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum) using your chapters's GitHub account (or your own personal GitHub account). You can use your own fork to make changes or tweaks to the curriculum for your own workshop. If you make changes that would be valuable for everyone, please consider making a pull request against the main curriculum.

Schedule
--------
Friday evening: Installfest - [Getting Set Up](outline/setup.md) in the outline.

Saturday: Workshop -  [curriculum](README.md#curriculum).

Preparation
-----------
Print the ([markdown](outline/cheatsheet.md) or [pdf](ClojureBridgeCheatsheet-v1.pdf)) and hand it out to students at the beginning of the day on Saturday.

Room Setup
----------
It works best to have attendees sit around tables, facing one another. This encourages attendees to help one another and makes it easier for TAs to walk around the room, answering questions.

Presentation of the Material
----------------------------
Most workshops have both teachers and TAs. Teachers present the material at the front of the room, and TAs and teachers help students as they work through the exercises on their own and with their tablemates. This is different from how RailsBridge usually works, where students generally work through the material in groups with the help of TAs.

This is not the only way to present the material. It is just the way we have seen it done at most of the workshops so far. Please feel free to experiment.

Light Table
-----------
Make sure to spend some time during the Installfest or at the beginning of Saturday showing a few key things to do in Light Table:

- Open the command pane with `Ctrl-Space`
- Start an Instarepl in the command pane by typing `Insta`
- Set the font size, enable auto-closing parentheses, or add line numbers in `Settings: User behaviors`
- Evaluate a file with `Cmd-Shift-Enter` or, on Windows, `Ctrl-Shift-Enter`
- Evaluate a form with `Cmd-Enter` or, on Windows, `Ctrl-Enter`

Students who want to do more can take a look at the [Light Table tutorial](http://docs.lighttable.com/tutorials/full/)

Beginner and Advanced Tracks
----------------------------
You can survey the attendees ahead of time or during the Installfest to find out their levels of programming experience. If you have multiple teachers available, you could present the material in separate rooms at a different pace, or you could present separate material. Alternatively, you could keep all attendees in the same room but seat them in different tables according to ability.

Exercises
---------
Provide plenty of time for exercises. That is where the real fun happens. TAs should sit with attendees or circulate around the tables as the attendees work on exercises.

Capstone App
------------
Budget your time so that you have enough time for the part. 2 project at the end of the day.
